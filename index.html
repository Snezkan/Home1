                    <h3>A Magical Realist Masterpiece</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Gray House</strong> is a magical realist novel by Armenian writer Mariam Petrosyan, 
                        originally published in Russian in 2009 and translated to English in 2017. This 732-page epic 
                        took Petrosyan 18 years to complete, resulting in a work that defies easy categorization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The story takes place in a mysterious boarding school for physically disabled children and teenagers, 
                        located in a run-down neighborhood on the outskirts of an unnamed town. These "children of the weeds" - 
                        abandoned by their families due to disabilities - navigate adolescence within the House's supernatural walls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The novel follows these residents as they form their own society with unique laws, customs, and hierarchies, 
                        completely separate from adult supervision. The story is told through multiple perspectives and timelines, 
                        creating a complex narrative that blends realistic coming-of-age elements with fantastical occurrences.

                    <p>
                        The House itself is far more than a building - it's a living, breathing entity with supernatural properties. 
                        This massive, hulking three-story structure has many rooms and seems to have a consciousness of its own, 
                        creating an eerie and mysterious atmosphere throughout the story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The building moves, shifts, and has a life of its own. It's described as having the ability to change 
                        its layout and create new spaces, making it both a sanctuary and a labyrinth for its residents. 
                        The House protects its children while simultaneously challenging them.

                    <h3>Physical Location & Setting</h3>
                    <p>
                        The principal's office is strategically located on the second floor of the Gray House, 
                        positioned opposite the staff room and canteen. This placement makes it part of the 
                        administrative heart of the institution, representing the formal authority structure 
                        within the House's complex hierarchy.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="principal-character">
                    <h3>The Principal</h3>
                    <p>
                        The principal is described as "a man very far removed from humanistic ideals," 
                        suggesting someone who lacks empathy or compassion toward the students. This 
                        characterization positions him as the antithesis of the caring, community-driven 
                        environment the students create for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The principal represents the cold, institutional approach to caring for disabled 
                        children - contrasting sharply with the magical, community-driven world that the 
                        students create within the House. He serves as an antagonistic force representing 
                        the "Outside" world's dehumanizing treatment of the disabled residents.
                    </p>

                <div class="office-context">
                    <h3>Historical Context</h3>
                    <p>
                        The current principal's appointment came after a traumatic graduation event described 
                        as leaving "a blood-soaked void so horrible that it frightened everyone." After this 
                        incident, the management was replaced, and most teachers and counselors left, except 
                        for a character named Ralph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new principal's appointment was significant enough to drive away remaining staff 
                        members who had survived the initial trauma, suggesting his approach was particularly 
                        harsh or unwelcome even by institutional standards.
                    </p>

                <div class="symbolic-role">
                    <h3>Symbolic Significance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rather than being a fully developed character, the principal functions more as a 
                        symbolic representation of institutional indifference. The novel focuses much more 
                        on the students' perspectives and experiences, with adult authority figures like 
                        the principal serving as representatives of the uncaring outside world that the 
                        children have learned to navigate and resist.
